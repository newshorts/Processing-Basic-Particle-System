INSTALLATION

To install, name a folder in your sketchbook "particleSystems". Then drag the contents of this repo into the folder. Or feel free to drag each sketch individually into your sketbook.

Dependencies (some of these sketch use libraries):

	particleTriangulate --> Triangulate Library (Available here: http://wiki.processing.org/images/f/f7/Triangulate-20100704.zip) (Example here: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Triangulation)


Make sure you restart Processing, after you install so it can find the folder.

NOTE: 	If you want to use "particleDefaultKinect" you must install daniel shiffman's "openKinect" for processing library. Find out more here: http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/
	Follow the install instructions, then start this sketch up and it should work. If you installed correctly, this sketch will automatically include everything you need to
	make it run.
