Mike Newell

This .pde was created to be a default particle system setup for processing. It initiates 200 particles with basic circular physics around the mouse. It's meant to be something to build upon...

INSTALLATION

To install, drag the "particleDefault" folder into your Processing sketchbook.

Make sure you restart Processing, after you install so it can find the folder.

NOTE: 	If you want to use "particleDefaultKinect" you must install daniel shiffman's "openKinect" for processing library. Find out more here: http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/
	Follow the install instructions, then start this sketch up and it should work. If you installed correctly, this sketch will automatically include everything you need to
	make it run.
